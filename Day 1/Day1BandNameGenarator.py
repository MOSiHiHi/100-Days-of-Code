# The code I wrote for the day 1 challenge:

print("Hi bro, I'm gonna generate you band names.")
city = input("What's your city name?!\n")
pet = input("What's your pet name?!\n")
band_name = city + " " + pet
print("Your band name is " + band_name)

# The code written by the author:

print("Welcome to the band name generator.")
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of a pet.\n")
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
