# 100 Days of Code Projects
This repository contains the projects for [100 Days of Code The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) written by me and compared to the author's code.\
Usually, in every exercise, the author suggests to pause the video and thinking about the problem and trying to solve it ourselves. So I try to solve the problem without watching the author write it using brain power and google(lol). after I solved the problem I compare my code with the author's and see if I can improve it then I write the improved code bellow the other two versions of code(my initial code and the author's).
