# 100 Days of Code Projects
This repository contains the projects for [100 Days of Code The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) I wrote and compared to the author's code.\
Usually, in every exercise, the author suggests pausing the video and thinking about the problem, and trying to solve it ourselves. So I try to solve the problem without watching the author write it using brain power and Google (lol). after I solved the problem I compare my code with the author's and see if I could improve it then I wrote the improved code below the other two versions of code (my initial code and the author's).
